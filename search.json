    "text": "Like much of the internet, I have been fascinated with the game Wordle. For those unaware, the basic premise is to guess a five letter word in less than six attempts. Unlike many such games, there is no initial clue. Your first guess is made blind, and then refined in subsequent rounds based on whether the letter was:\nIt’s a simple mechanic, and quite fun. Part of the appeal comes from the fact that it’s really a logic game. Since the potential solution space becomes very small very quickly; intelligent early guesses can remove vast swathes of dictionary from consideration. So the key question is; what are the best words to guess first?"

As the goal is to provide guidance in uncertainty, it tends to be highly opinionated - irrespective of the level of evidence supporting those opinions. Reasonable people may disagree.\nUnlike Part One, which is (or at least, was) “complete”, this is still very much under construction. Many core topics are absent, others will be covered only partially and sometimes incorrectly, particularly if it is a topic I stumbled upon years ago and have not dusted off since.\nIn particular (and somewhat counter-intuitively), things I know quite well are often covered poorly (if at all), and may reflect the incomplete or incorrect understanding I held when I first came across them. Conversely, topics I can claim only a passing association or interest with may be covered in unrestrained detail as I need to refresh heavily each time they arise.\nIt can be viewed here."
