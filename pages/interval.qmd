## How to Use

1. **Input** the **trial data** into the contingency table.
2. Next, **set** a **prior** probability for the control and intervention groups.\
The sliders will set 95% of the probability mass between each extreme, with the maximum value approximately between them. Identical rates in both groups indicate clinical equipoise.
3. If required, **adjust** the Highest Density Interval (**HDI**) and Region of Practical Equivalence (**ROPE**) to the desired values.\
    * The 95% threshold for the HDI is fundamentally arbitrary, but is used by convention.
    * The Region of Practical Equivalence is the region where the effect size is weak enough to be considered clinically negligible. This is intervention-dependent: complex or expensive treatments will generally require a wider ROPE.
