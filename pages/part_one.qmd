## What it is

[Part One](partone.litfl.com) is a reference for trainees preparing for the CICM and ANZCA Primary Exams.


* Part One is:
  * Designed to cover the assessed sections of the CICM and ANZCA curricula in enough detail to pass
  * A rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
  * A tool to correct your written answers
  * A source of information you might find difficult to find elsewhere
  
* Part One is not:
  * A textbook  
  * The definitive guide to the primary exam
  * A complete reference
